# cycles
Adds an incredibly poorly done day night cycle to TERA because I was bored
# WIP BRANCH MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE MANIFEST AND MODULE.JSON OR IT'LL OVERWRITE

## Commands

Command | Argument(s) |  Description
---|---|---
cycle on| - |  turns the mod on |
cycle off | - | turns the mod off
cycle reset | - | resets the counter don't use this it's probably broken
cycle time| time in ms | sets the interval between changes, also broken but will change it while breaking things
cycle t | Aero number | dumb test command, just use AA instead, too lazy to remove this

## Help
If you want to help out, please give me more Aero names (Use AA to get em) and a time value (1-4, with 1 being morning and 4 being night) on discord or in an issue thing.
